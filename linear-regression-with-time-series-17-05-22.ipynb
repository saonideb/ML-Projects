Businesses forecast product demand, governments forecast economic and population growth, meteorologists forecast the weather. The understanding of things to come is a pressing need across science, government, and industry (not to mention our personal lives!), and practitioners in these fields are increasingly applying machine learning to address this need.\n\nTime series forecasting is a broad field with a long history. This course focuses on the application of modern machine learning methods to time series data with the goal of producing the most accurate predictions. The lessons in this course were inspired by winning solutions from past Kaggle forecasting competitions but will be applicable whenever accurate forecasts are a priority.\n\nAfter finishing this course, you'll know how to:\n- engineer features to model the major time series components (*trends*, *seasons*, and *cycles*),\n- visualize time series with many kinds of *time series plots*,\n- create forecasting *hybrids* that combine the strengths of complementary models, and\n- adapt machine learning methods to a variety of forecasting tasks.\n\nAs part of the exercises, you'll get a chance to participate in our [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/29781) Getting Started competition. In this competition, you're tasked with forecasting sales for *Corporaci√≥n Favorita* (a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer) in almost 1800 product categories.\n\n# What is a Time Series? #\n\nThe basic object of forecasting is the **time series**, which is a set of observations recorded over time. In forecasting applications, the observations are typically recorded with a regular frequency, like daily or monthly.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    \"../input/ts-course-data/book_sales.csv\",\n    index_col='Date',\n    parse_dates=['Date'],\n).drop('Paperback', axis=1)\n\ndf.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This series records the number of hardcover book sales at a retail store over 30 days. Notice that we have a single column of observations `Hardcover` with a time index `Date`.\n\n# Linear Regression with Time Series #\n\nFor the first part of this course, we'll use the linear regression algorithm to construct forecasting models. Linear regression is widely used in practice and adapts naturally to even complex forecasting tasks.\n\nThe **linear regression** algorithm learns how to make a weighted sum from its input features. For two features, we would have:\n\n```\ntarget = weight_1 * feature_1 + weight_2 * feature_2 + bias\n```\n\nDuring training, the regression algorithm learns values for the parameters `weight_1`, `weight_2`, and `bias` that best fit the `target`. (This algorithm is often called *ordinary least squares* since it chooses values that minimize the squared error between the target and the predictions.) The weights are also called *regression coefficients* and the `bias` is also called the *intercept* because it tells you where the graph of this function crosses the y-axis.\n\n### Time-step features\n\nThere are two kinds of features unique to time series: time-step features and lag features.\n\nTime-step features are features we can derive directly from the time index. The most basic time-step feature is the **time dummy**, which counts off time steps in the series from beginning to end.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf['Time'] = np.arange(len(df.index))\n\ndf.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Linear regression with the time dummy produces the model:\n\n```\ntarget = weight * time + bias\n```\n\nThe time dummy then lets us fit curves to time series in a *time plot*, where `Time` forms the x-axis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn-whitegrid\")\nplt.rc(\n    \"figure\",\n    autolayout=True,\n    figsize=(11, 4),\n    titlesize=18,\n    titleweight='bold',\n)\nplt.rc(\n    \"axes\",\n    labelweight=\"bold\",\n    labelsize=\"large\",\n    titleweight=\"bold\",\n    titlesize=16,\n    titlepad=10,\n)\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot('Time', 'Hardcover', data=df, color='0.75')\nax = sns.regplot(x='Time', y='Hardcover', data=df, ci=None, scatter_kws=dict(color='0.25'))\nax.set_title('Time Plot of Hardcover Sales');","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Time-step features let you model **time dependence**. A series is time dependent if its values can be predicted from the time they occured.

A time series has serial dependence when an observation can be predicted from previous observations. In *Hardcover Sales*, we can predict that high sales on one day usually mean high sales the next day.\n\n---\n\nAdapting machine learning algorithms to time series problems is largely about feature engineering with the time index and lags. For most of the course, we use linear regression for its simplicity, but these features will be useful whichever algorithm you choose for your forecasting task.\n\n# Example - Tunnel Traffic #\n\n*Tunnel Traffic* is a time series describing the number of vehicles traveling through the Baregg Tunnel in Switzerland each day from November 2003 to November 2005.
